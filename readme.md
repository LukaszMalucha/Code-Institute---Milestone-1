# ML Library Project

[Visit Website](https://lukaszmalucha.github.io/ML-Library/)

## Project Case:
Acquiring information about specific machine learning algorithms might be time-consuming sometimes.
We not always have a time to go through official documentation, especially when we sit with our mobile phone and our job interview starts in 15 mins…..

And what about a programmer that already know all of the foundations and quick, keyword-reminder is all that he is looking for? 

## Goal Statement:
Goal of the project is to create robust, fully-responsive, open-source URL platform where user will be able to find information about particular machine learning algorithm. Data will be easily accessible and in the compact form. It will be ML cheat sheet in a form of a website. Project will be stored on GitHub.

## Target Group:
Users that already have knowledge regarding ML algorithms and need only some quick memory refresher. 

## Project Timeline:
1.	Create website layout mockup.
2.	Create graphic design
3.	Create main page
4.	Create selection pages
5.	Create algorithm pages 
6.	Create support pages
7.	Apply Responsive Design
8.	Responsivity Test
9.	Link Web Pages together
10.	Link Test
11.	GitHub Deployment
12.	Write Project Document
13.	Web Browser tests
14.	Final Tests

## Project Scope:
ML Library will be fully responsive for mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktop screens.<br>
ML Library will be a base platform for future Milestone projects (Data Dashboard etc.)<br>
ML Library will have aesthetic graphic design.<br>
Information will be in a quickly accessible compact form.<br>
ML Library page won’t be heavy-content.<br>
ML Library will be easily transformable into web application.<br>
ML Library page architecture will be easy to maintain.<br>
ML Library page will be easy to update.<br>

## Out of Project Scope:
ML Library will not be replacement for official documentation page.<br>
ML Library won’t have detailed information about algorithms.<br>
ML Library won’t content unnecessary text information.<br>
